SyncIPOD 0.63
=============

I take no responsibility for ANYTHING! 
Read the COPYING file.

You need:

  * an ipod ;-) [FAT32 ipod]
  * a kernel with firewire and scsi [latest ieee1394 modules]
  * Perl5 [modules: MP3::Info, Unicode::String, File::Copy, Filesys::DiskFree]

You get:

  * syncronisation with

    a) a local directory (recommended: just a dir of links)
    b) a master playlist (directory + a filtering playlist, needed when the
       directory is larger than you ipod)
    c) just playlists, which point anywhere within your mounted filesystems

  * optional playlists

  * on the fly created playlists

  * mp3 info from

    a) mp3 tags
    b) filenames

To install:

  Type "./install"
  Then look at "~/.ipod/config" and check your configuration.

To uninstall:

  Remove the directory: ~/.ipod and the files ~/bin/SyncPOD and ~/bin/sync_pod.pl

To use the program:

  Type "SyncPOD" or "sync_pod.pl" and let your mp3's sync to your ipod.
  If your ipod has no filesystem structure use "SyncPOD -c" to create it and sync
  later. Using your ipod for the first time (with this program and an existing
  filesystem structure) you may need to use: "SyncPOD -f" to christian it.
  (Or you DON'T use this command, if you don't want to sync THIS ipod.)

If this program creates iTunesDB files that do NOT work, do the following:

  a) write a description of what does not work
  b) get the full output of the SyncPOD command (stdout and stderr)
  c) get the full output of the following (stdout and stderr) - if it loops kill the process

    DumpPOD <iTunesDB file>

and send it to me. (armin [at] xos [dot] net)

Enjoy.
